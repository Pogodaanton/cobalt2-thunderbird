# Cobalt2 for Thunderbird

An unofficial faithful re-implementation of [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) for Thunderbird.

## Key Features and Design Philosophy

- User interface colors provided by the official [VSCode theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode)
- Contrast and minimalistic use of accent colors is first priority
- Patches missing theme properties in Thunderbird's extension framework in order to keep the theme consistent across all parts of Thunderbird
- Supports only latest Thunderbird ESR builds, no backwards compatibility

## Download and Releases

To always have the most up-to-date version of the theme:

1. Open your Thunderbird client
2. Go to Settings
3. Open "Add-ons and Themes"
4. Use the search bar at "Find more add-ons" to look-up `Cobalt2`.
5. Install the theme and automatically receive updates

> [!TIP]
> Help spread the word by giving a review on the [add-ons page](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/cobalt2/) and help improving the theme by reporting bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Pogodaanton/cobalt2-thunderbird/issues).

If you'd like to manually install the extension, an archive of past versions can be found under [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Pogodaanton/cobalt2-thunderbird/releases).
